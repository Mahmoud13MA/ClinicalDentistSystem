A **RESTful Web API** built with **ASP.NET Core (C#)** designed to manage the complete clinical workflow of a dental clinic — from patient registration and appointments to AI-assisted clinical documentation and inventory tracking.

## 💡 Project Idea

The **Clinical Dentist System** was built to solve a real operational problem in dental clinics: fragmented and manual clinical processes. Instead of managing patients, appointments, records, and stock across multiple spreadsheets or basic tools, this system centralizes everything.

The core idea is to give dental staff a **single backend system** that:
- Tracks the full patient journey — from booking to completed treatment.
- Stores rich **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** with structured dental data (teeth, procedures, X-rays, medications).
- Introduces **AI assistance** (via a local LLaMA model through Ollama) to help doctors write clinical notes, look up dental terminology, suggest treatments, and extract structured data from free-form text.
- Enforces **role-based access** so that doctors and nurses each have appropriate permissions.
- Manages **clinic supplies and stock** with full transaction history.

This project is intended to serve as a backend API, designed to integrate with a frontend (e.g., a Next.js application).

## ✨ Features

### 👤 Authentication & Authorization
- Separate **Doctor** and **Nurse** registration and login flows.
- Registration protected by a **clinic-issued registration key** (configured server-side).
- **JWT-based authentication** with role claims (`Doctor` / `Nurse`).
- **Role-based access control** — some endpoints are restricted to doctors only (`DoctorOnly` policy).

### 🧑‍⚕️ Patient Management
- Create, read, update, and delete patient profiles.
- Patient fields: first name, middle name, last name, gender, date of birth, phone.

### 📅 Appointment Scheduling
- Create and manage appointments linked to a patient, doctor, and nurse.
- Auto-generated reference numbers per appointment.
- Appointment types, dates, and times tracked.

### 🗂️ Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Full EHR per appointment/patient including:
  - **Medical info**: allergies, medical alerts.
  - **Dental info**: diagnosis, X-ray findings, periodontal status, clinical notes, recommendations, treatment history.
  - **Structured collections**: medications, procedures (with procedure codes), and per-tooth records.
- **Audit trail / change log**: every field-level change is logged with who changed it, when, and from which appointment.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Clinical Documentation (LLaMA via Ollama)
- **Auto-complete** for partial clinical note text.
- **Dental terminology suggestions** from partial terms.
- **Generate full clinical notes** from bullet points.
- **Treatment suggestions** based on diagnosis and patient history.
- **Structured data extraction** from free-form clinical text.
- **Full EHR parsing** — doctor writes a large block of text, and the AI extracts all EHR fields automatically.

### 🏥 Staff Management
- Manage **Doctor** profiles (Doctor-only access).
- Manage **Nurse** profiles (create/update restricted to doctors).

### 📦 Supply & Inventory Management
- Manage dental supplies with categories, units, and quantities.
- Filter supplies by category.
- Track **stock transactions** (who used what and when).
- View transaction history per doctor or per supply item.

### 🔒 Security
- Passwords stored as **hashed values** (never plain text).
- All core endpoints require a valid JWT token.
- Sensitive management endpoints enforce the `DoctorOnly` authorization policy.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **[.NET SDK 8.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)** (check `clinical.APIs.csproj` for exact target version).
2. **SQL Server** (local or remote).
3. **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** with the `llama3.1:8b` model pulled (for AI features):
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   ```

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoldenBoy13420/ClinicalDentistSystem.git
   cd ClinicalDentistSystem
   ```

2. **Configure Database & Secrets:**
   Update the `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json` file with your SQL Server connection string and JWT settings:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=ClinicalDentistDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
   }
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the API:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   Navigate to `https://localhost:<port>/swagger` to view and test the endpoints.
